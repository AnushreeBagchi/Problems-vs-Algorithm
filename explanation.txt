1. 
If the given number is n. Then the square root of that number will be between 1 and the number.
Here I am taking the mid point of the start and the end point and checking if that square of the mid point is equal to the the input number.
If square of mid is less than the number, then changing the starting point to mid+1
else if mid is greater than the number then changing the end point to mid -1

Time complexity : O(logn) --> make table
Space complexity : O(1)

5. Autocomplete with Trie:



6. Max and Min in a Unsorted Array:
here in order to get the min and max in O(n) time complexityb, I have taken 2 variables min and max. 
I have loop through the entire arrray once comparing the array value with the min and max. If num is greater than max the replacing the value of max.
If num is less than min then replacing value of min
